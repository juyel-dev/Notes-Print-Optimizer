## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Settings & Information Center: the hamburger drawer is now a config-driven
  menu (Tools, Privacy, Community, Resources, Legal, Developer) rendered from
  `lib/menu` metadata with an accessible accordion UI
- In-app documents (About, User Guide, FAQ, What's New, Changelog, Privacy
  Policy, Terms of Use, JSL License, Copyright Notice) rendered from Markdown
  in `public/content/`
- Feedback reachable from the menu via a modal reusing the existing form
- Clear Cache privacy action; Telegram community/channel and contact links
- App and drawer footer with copyright and contact email

### Changed
- Re-licensed from MIT to the Juyel Source License (JSL) v1.0
  (LICENSE, package.json, README, CONTRIBUTING)
- Updated feedback Google Apps Script endpoint to the new web app URL

### Removed
- Old workflow-navigator drawer content (install banner, phase shortcuts,
  quick actions, legacy footer)

### Added (previous)
- Smart PDF Rearrangement: automatic detection of related PDF series
  (e.g. "Basic Maths and Calculus 1..13 Class Notes") with rule-based
  natural sorting (numbers, ordinals, roman numerals, zero-padding)
- New `lib/rearrange` module with a modular parser / normalizer / sorter /
  rule-engine architecture (zero new dependencies, browser-only)
- Drag & drop reordering of uploaded files in all platform views
  (arrow buttons remain as the touch/keyboard fallback)
- One-click "Smart Arrange" action with series detection badge in the
  Phase-1 file sequence panel (`components/FileSequencePanel.tsx`)
- Uploaded series are auto-arranged as files arrive; unrelated files keep
  their upload order
- Unit test coverage for the rearrangement pipeline (parser, normalizer,
  sorter, rule engine, edge cases, performance smoke test)
