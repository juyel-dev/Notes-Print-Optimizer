# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Adaptive PWA **Install/Share card** at the top of the Settings drawer:
  shows a beautiful install card (native add-to-home-screen) when the app is
  not installed, and switches to a **Share this app** card (Web Share API with
  copy-link fallback) once installed
- Install card shows benefit chips (Fast / Offline / Private) and an iOS
  "Add to Home Screen" guide

### Changed
- Install prompt UI now lives **only inside the drawer** (nothing renders
  outside the hamburger menu)

### Removed
- `InstallBanner` (replaced by the adaptive `InstallShareCard`)
- Unused `InstallButton` component

### Added (previous)
- Unit tests for the menu module: Markdown renderer (escaping/XSS/lists/links),
  MenuRegistry (register/resolve/validate/hidden filtering) and contentLoader
  (fetch mocking + caching), plus a config-integration sanity suite
- PWA install banner in the Settings drawer, shown only while the app is not
  installed; shared `useInstallPrompt` hook (lib/pwa) now backs both the banner
  and the header InstallButton

- Settings & Information Center: the hamburger drawer is now a config-driven
  menu (Tools, Privacy, Community, Resources, Legal, Developer) rendered from
  `lib/menu` metadata with an accessible accordion UI
- In-app documents (About, User Guide, FAQ, What's New, Changelog, Privacy
  Policy, Terms of Use, JSL License, Copyright Notice) rendered from Markdown
  in `public/content/`
- Feedback reachable from the menu via a modal reusing the existing form
- Clear Cache privacy action; Telegram community/channel and contact links
- App and drawer footer with copyright and contact email
- Smart PDF Rearrangement: automatic detection of related PDF series
  (e.g. "Basic Maths and Calculus 1..13 Class Notes") with rule-based
  natural sorting (numbers, ordinals, roman numerals, zero-padding)
- New `lib/rearrange` module with a modular parser / normalizer / sorter /
  rule-engine architecture (zero new dependencies, browser-only)
- Drag & drop reordering of uploaded files in all platform views
  (arrow buttons remain as the touch/keyboard fallback)
- One-click "Smart Arrange" action with series detection badge in the
  Phase-1 file sequence panel (`components/FileSequencePanel.tsx`)
- Uploaded series are auto-arranged as files arrive; unrelated files keep
  their upload order
- Unit test coverage for the rearrangement pipeline (parser, normalizer,
  sorter, rule engine, edge cases, performance smoke test)

### Changed
- Re-licensed from MIT to the Juyel Source License (JSL) v1.0
  (LICENSE, package.json, README, CONTRIBUTING)
- Updated feedback Google Apps Script endpoint to the new web app URL

### Removed
- Old workflow-navigator drawer content (install banner, phase shortcuts,
  quick actions, legacy footer)
